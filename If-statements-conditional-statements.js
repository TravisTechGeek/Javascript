// Conditional Statements
// IF Statements
// Using the let keyword, declare a variable named sale. Assign the value true to it.
let sale = true
// Now create an if statement. Provide the if statement with a condition of sale.
// Inside the code block of the if statement, console.log() the string 'Time to buy!'.
sale = false
if (sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!')
}

// Notice that the code inside the if statement ran, since 'Time to buy!' was logged to the console.

// Below the sale variable declaration, but before the if statement, reassign sale to false. 
// Run your code and observe what happens, we’ll be changing this behavior in the next exercise.
